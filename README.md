 | Weeb launcher with db counters and a near-customizable interface.

This cost 5 hours of my time, and it (for some reason) works pretty well!

SETUP:

This program is designed to work in portable storage devices like
flash drives, hard drives, your attic, etc.

IT MAY NOT WORK PROPERLY WHEN EXECUTED IN DRIVE C: OR D:!!

1 - To start, copy the "woq-chan" folder to the ROOT of your preferred
storage device.

2 - Open woq-chan and edit "srolib.bat"

3 - srolib.bat is is the configuration file. You may now input the path
of your weeb crests into the following variables:

anisc = The folder that will open via Animu > Completed.
anisc2 = The folder that will open via Animu > Ongoing.
mangsc = The folder that will open via Animu > Manga.

hensc = The folder that will open via ARA ARA ~ > Hentai.
doujsc1 = The folder that will open via ARA ARA ~ > Nhentai.
doujsc2 = The folder that will open via ARA ARA ~ > Tsumino.

ex: set anisc=F:\Anime\Completed

Protip: You may use %lib% to automatically detect the drive letter (ex: %lib%\Anime)

4 - After setting the above, you can now start Woq-Chan.bat, or Woq-Chan.exe.
The EXE does not support image backgrounds.
